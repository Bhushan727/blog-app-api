        content : "Swara Bhasker recently opened up about the ongoing boycott Bollywood trend on social media. Days after she spoke about Akshay Kumar, and said that celebrities were a soft target of criticism, Swara has now spoken about Karan Johar. She said the filmmaker was attacked by a section of people after Sushant Singh Rajput's death in 2020. Swara said criticising Karan for his films or for promoting ‘nepotism’ in film industry was one thing, but calling him a ‘murderer’ after Sushant died was unfair.

        content : "Anil Kapoor had revealed on the latest episode of Koffee With Karan season 7 that he was insecure about Jackie Shroff's success after the latter had bagged a film under Subhash Ghai's banner. Karan had asked Anil to share his views on nepotism, when the actor had spoken about Jackie and said that despite being an ‘outsider’ he had become an A-lister, at a time when Anil was ‘doing bit roles'. Now, Jackie has reacted to Anil's statement. In a new interview, the actor said that when a man of Anil’s calibre says something like that, he was giving Jackie too much respect. Also read: Anil Kapoor was insecure about Jackie Shroff. During Koffee With Karan season 7 episode 11, Karan had asked Anil Kapoor and the other guest on the show, Varun Dhawan, a question about nepotism. Anil had said, I don't take it seriously… When I started my career, at that time it was of course Sunny (Deol), there was Sanju (Sanjay Dutt). When Karan interrupted to add Jackie Shroff's name, Anil had said, Jackie was an outsider in a way, but still he got the first break from Subhash Ghai. So, he himself became like an A-lister just with that one announcement. I, at that time, was doing bit roles, I was doing south Indian films. I did kind of, (was) not feeling good about it… When Karan further asked Anil, Did you feel insecure about Jackie's success at that time? the actor responded by saying, Well yeah. He became a huge, huge success ",

        content : `“Today, it’s easier to become an actor because people have access to social media and other mediums where they can show their talents be it with reels or on YouTube and reach out to the audience. There’s money, ad deals and fan interactions on digital platforms and it’s your call on how approachable you want to be or even how greedy,” says the Balika Vadhu actor.

        Having been in the business for years, she admits it gets difficult for her “to be out there”. “I end up thinking, let’s do it as everyone else is (very active on social media) and it’s not a big deal. But deep down, it doesn’t feel right, hence, I take a step back. For example, making those lip sync reels isn’t something I should do in my career right now even though at the end of the day that seems to get you followers and once you get followers, good brands come to you,” she explains.`,
