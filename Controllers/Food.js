        content : "According to a notification issued by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on June 14, the two-factor authentication can be done using biometric authentication along with the knowledge/possession factor.Biometric authentication uses fingerprint scanning, face recognition or voice recognition.The knowledge factor for the two-factor authentication is done using details which are only known by the user such as password, and PIN, the NSE said in its notification.The possession factor, on the other hand, is done with details that only the user has, for example an OTP, security token, authenticator apps on smartphones etc. In the case of OTP, the same should be sent to clients through both email and SMS on their registered email ID and Mobile number. “In cases where biometric authentication is not possible, Members shall use both the aforementioned factors (Knowledge factor and Possession factor), in addition to the user ID, for 2-factor authentication (2FA). It is to be noted that the above-mentioned authentication shall be implemented on every login session by the client to IBT and STWT,” the NSE further said in its June 14 notification.",

The funeral for the late monarch saw leaders from all over the world travelling to the UK to pay their last respects to Britain's longest-serving monarch who passed away aged 96 on September 8. All members of the royal family also bid their final farewell. Following the private burial service that was attended only by the members of the family of the late monarch, a poignant tribute was paid to Queen Elizabeth on the social media account of the royal family as Buckingham Palace shared an unseen vintage photo of the late monarch from 1971. In the picture, the Queen can be seen holding a walking stick while wearing a green coat and patterned head scarf.  The photograph captures the Queen at Balmoral, her residence in Scotland, in 1971, according to Sky News. The photo was taken by Patrick Lichfield, who is the 5th Earl of Lichfield. Along with the photo, the Palace shared a poignant message that said, May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest. In loving memory of Her Majesty The Queen. 1926 - 2022  in reference to Shakespeare's Hamlet ",
